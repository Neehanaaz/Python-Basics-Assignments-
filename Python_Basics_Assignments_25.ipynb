        "1) . What is the difference between enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets and parentheses?\n",
        "Enclosing a list comprehension in square brackets creates a list comprehension, while enclosing it in parentheses creates a generator expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "A list comprehension is a way of creating a new list by applying an expression to each item in an iterable. The result is a new list containing the results of the expression applied to each item. Here is an example of a list comprehension:\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, a generator expression is a way of creating a generator object that produces the results of the expression on-the-fly, as they are requested. A generator expression is created using parentheses instead of brackets. Here is an example of a generator expression:\n",

        "2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
        "Generators and iterators are closely related concepts in Python. In fact, a generator is a type of iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which requires it to have a __next__() method that returns the next value in a sequence or raises StopIteration when there are no more values to be returned. Iterators can be used to iterate over any sequence of values, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "A generator is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function that contains one or more yield statements. When the function is called, it returns a generator object, which can be used to iterate over the values generated by the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "One key difference between generators and other iterators is that generators generate values on-the-fly, as they are requested, rather than generating all the values up-front. This can make generators more memory-efficient than other iterators, especially when dealing with large datasets.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3) What are the signs that a function is a generator function?\n",
        "A function is a generator function if it contains at least one yield statement. The presence of a yield statement in a function is what makes it a generator function.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Another sign that a function is a generator function is that it does not return a value using the return keyword. Instead, the function returns a generator object when it is called, which can be used to iterate over the values generated by the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important to note that calling a generator function does not actually execute the function's code. Instead, it creates a generator object that can be used to execute the function's code on-the-fly as values are requested. When a generator function is called, it returns a generator object that can be used to iterate over the values generated by the function. The generator object is an iterator that can be used with the next() function or in a for loop to generate values on-the-fly.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4) What is the purpose of a yield statement?\n",
        "The yield statement is used in Python to define a generator function. The purpose of a yield statement is to yield a value from the generator function to the calling code, while also suspending the state of the generator function so that it can be resumed later.\n",
        "\n",
        "When a yield statement is executed in a generator function, the value specified after the yield keyword is returned to the calling code as the next value in the sequence. The state of the generator function is then suspended, and the calling code can continue executing until it requests the next value from the generator object.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the generator object is iterated over again (using the next() function or a for loop), the generator function is resumed from the point where it was suspended by the previous yield statement. The function then continues executing until it reaches the next yield statement, at which point it yields another value and suspends again.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process continues until the generator function has yielded all the values in the sequence, at which point it raises a StopIteration exception to signal that there are no more values to be generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "The yield statement is a powerful tool for generating sequences of values on-the-fly, especially when dealing with large or infinite sequences that would be impractical to generate all at once. By suspending the state of the generator function between yields, the yield statement allows the function to generate values lazily, as they are requested, making it more memory-efficient than other methods of generating sequences.\n",

        "5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and contrast between the two.\n",
        "Both map() calls and list comprehensions are used in Python to transform iterables into new iterables using a function or expression. However, there are some differences between the two.\n",
        "\n",
        "map() is a built-in Python function that applies a function to each element of an iterable and returns a new iterable containing the results. The syntax for map() is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "The function argument is a function that takes a single argument and returns a transformed value. The iterable argument is an iterable that contains the values to be transformed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "List comprehensions, on the other hand, are a Python syntax for creating new lists by applying an expression to each element of an iterable. The syntax for a list comprehension is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "The expression is an expression that takes an element of the iterable and returns a transformed value. The item is a variable that takes on each value in the iterable. The condition is an optional condition that filters which values to include in the new list.\n",
        "\n",
        "One key difference between map() and list comprehensions is that map() always returns an iterable, even if the input is not an iterable (in which case it will raise a TypeError). List comprehensions, on the other hand, always return a list, even if the input is not a list (in which case it will be converted to a list first).\n",
        "\n",
        "Another difference is that list comprehensions can include conditional statements to filter the input iterable, while map() can only apply the function to every element of the input iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of performance, list comprehensions are generally faster than map() calls for simple transformations, but map() can be more efficient for more complex transformations that require calling an external function.\n",
