        "\n",
        "Ans: RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, Alpha. It's a color model used in digital graphics, where each color is represented by a combination of red, green, and blue values, and the alpha value represents the transparency or opacity of the color. The alpha value ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque). The RGBA model is commonly used in web design and digital imaging software.\n",
